    Hi, my name is Matteo Piano, I was born in Asti (Italy) and I'm <span id="age">24</span> years old (if my age looks weird to you, you should probably fix the clock on your system &#x1F601).
    <br>
    In 2018 I obtained a double master degree in <i>Computer Science and Engineering</i> from <a href="https://www.kth.se">KTH university</a> in Stockholm and in <i>Software Engineering</i> from <a href="https://www.polito.it">Politecnico di Torino</a>.
    The topic of <a href="http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-220524">my degree project</a> was the development of a binary rewriter to instrument executable files against <i>Return Oriented Programming</i> attacks.
    <br>
    I am currently employed as a cyber-security consultant in <a href="https://www.reply.com">Spike Reply</a> working alongside the <i>FCA Group</i> ICT team located in Turin on projects regarding connected vehicles and industry 4.0.

  <script>
    var today = new Date();
    if(today.getFullYear() > 2017) { // Just to check that your system clock is not in the past
      var age = today.getFullYear() - 1993
                - (today.getMonth() < 10 || (today.getMonth() == 10 && today.getDate() < 23) ? 1 : 0);
      document.getElementById('age').innerHTML = age;
    }
