All projects must start somewhere, and when you are a software developer they usually do with that familiar "Hello World!" on a black terminal.
This is the first post for what will a blog telling the progress of my small project for the 2017 instance of the course _DH2323 Computer Graphics and Interaction_. The project specification has been sent and I am now waiting for it to be approved. If everything goes as expected, this blog will describe the creation of a cloth simulation using the [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) graphics library.
